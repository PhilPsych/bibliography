        <p id="vessonnen">Vessonnen, E. (2017). Psychometrics versus Representational Theory of Measurement. <i>Philosophy of the Social Sciences, 47</i> (4-5): 330-350. <a class="paper" href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0048393117705299" target="_blank">doi:10.1177/0048393117705299</a></p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">Vessonnen's paper argues that it is possible to simultaneously endorse both psychometrics and the representational theory of measurement (RTM). She first establishes her position by arguing that RTM and psychometrics have distinct sources of validity; RTM measurements possess representational interpretability while psychometrics provide procedural validity. Vessonnen then iterates that RTM does not address measurement's need for procedural validity – the theory does not help metrologists build measurement procedure. Conversely, psychometricians tend to assume the validity of the scales they use, rather than establishing representational interpretability by mirroring the scale against the empirical relationships of the target construct. As both theories are partial approaches that deal with different measurement conditions, Vessonnen argues that embracing both theories simultaneously is not only possible, but can yield fruitful results for researchers.</p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">The paper is built as a charitable critique of Angner (2011), that argues for the incompatibility between RTM and psychometrics. Substantial definitions are given to each term by the author at its introduction. Similar to Humphry (2017), the author believes that RTM is an incomplete theory of measurement. Interestingly, this author establishes psychometrics as its own measurement theory, contradictory to Borsboom (2005).</p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">This article is a critique of the improper use of the term 'theory' by different psychological measurement methodologies. Humphry first defines theory as the theoretical framework used to explain specific phenomena. With this definition established, Humphries critiques item response theory (IRT) and the representational theory of measurement (RTM) for not being true 'theories' – these models only prescribe which strict conditions are required for measurement, and does not explain how scientific theories can support said measure. The author later establishes that as IRT and RTM do not account for measurement's need to be supported by 'substantive theory', these models are partial and quasi-empirical. He ends by establishing a substantive theory of measurement, and warns psychometricians that psychological measurement cannot be possible unless psychologists develop substantive theories that can be used to develop well-defined units of measurement.</p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">The author structures his article as a critique of Joel Michell's "The Rasch Paradox, Conjoint Measurement and Psychometrics" (2014) (which critiqued Humphry's earlier work) as well as strongly supporting RTM as a complete theory. Humphry uses a strong example to demonstrate the usefulness of the substantive theory of measurement, but he does not define the key terms he uses, such as RTM, ITM, and Rasch models.</p>

Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands. <a class="paper" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-024-0979-6_6/fulltext.html" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">The paper criticises the metrological foundations of Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and offers suggestions that address her critiques. The author starts by claiming that, as PROMs are based on classical test theory (CTT), PROMs lack a theory of measurement interaction that demonstrates the relationship between the target construct and the instrument of measure (e.g.: a questionnaire). This leads to problems with validity, interpretability, and responsiveness. Consequently, McClimans suggests that psychometricians exercise Rasch methodology to build a theory of measurement interaction. Rasch does this by creating a mathematical model that builds empirical relationships between measurement items and measured items. Although McClimans does believe that PROMs can be improved with Rasch methodologies, she also warns that one should apply Rasch models with strong theoretical guidance to build adequate sensitivity in the model.</p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">McClimans defines Rasch methodology similarly to how Borsboom (2005) defines the representational measurement model. Her critique of CTT is congruent with Vesonnen's critique of Psychometrics. Namely, both models lack a justification for their use of an integer scale to represent their data. McClimans, Vesonnen, and Humphry all agree that well-defined units of measure are a necessary condition of measurement; this component is not satisfied by CTT or Psychometrics.</p>

Moeßner (Eds.), <i>Reasoning in Measurement</i> (pp. 146-157). London: Routledge. <a class="paper" href="LINK" style="color: #FF0000;" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">Kaminski's paper is critique of the philosophy of science's treatment of psychometrics, and argues for the embrace of the technical applications of the measurement. Kaminski first starts his argument by highlighting that, no matter the critique of psychometrics, each critique fails to recognise that psychometrics has had useful social consequences. The author then suggests that comparisons between classical measurements and mental measurements fail to recognise that applications of psychometrics involve a subject that is aware of its own measurement. This explains psychometrics' success as a technical application; psychometrics are tools that create self-relation in a subject, which has great personal and social consequences. The importance of self-relation is shown by examining psychometrics as a direct cause of the Lynn-Flynn Effect.</p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">This paper strongly suggests that an approach from the philosophy of science is insufficient to build a charitable critique of psychometrics - one must also approach it from a philosophy of technological perspective. This implies that the critique that psychometrics offers an incomplete model of measurement (see: Vessonnen 2017, McClimans 2017) should be considered alongside evidence that demonstrates the social success of psychometrics. Further pieces that criticise psychometrics from the philosophy of technology would be an excellent supplement to this piece.</p>

Is Psychometrics Pathological Science? <i>Measurement: Interdisciplinary Research and Perspectives 6</i> (1-2), 7-24. <a class="paper" href="http://statmath.wu.ac.at/courses/r-se-mbr/dl/Michell_Psychometrics_Pathology_2008.pdf" target="_blank">doi:10.1080/15366360802035489</a></p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">In a strong critique of the measurement discipline, Mitchell structures this paper to support the idea of psychometrics as a pathological science. The author first defines the pathology of science as the collective failure of a field to recognise its own prejudice that ultimately prevents true science from taking place. Psychometrics is considered pathological as it refuses to recognise that it assumes that mental qualities are quantitative. The author suggests that this pathology was created out of ideological and economic interests to make psychology a 'valid science'. The paper also critiques more modern attempts to remove the pathology from psychometrics, such as the item response model (ITM), as it too ultimately assumes that the measures it takes are quantitative, not ordinal. The paper ends with the author suggesting what steps would be necessary to prove that mental measures provide quantitative (and not just interval) information, which would 'depathologise' the rest of the measurement field.</p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">Like Humphry (2017), this paper also expresses that psychometrics is a 'quasi-empirical' field. This belief is also implicitly present in Vessonnen (2017) and Kaminski (2017), strongly suggesting that psychometrics should be viewed as a partial approach to measurement, that must be bolstered by a relational theory (again, see Vessonnen 2017).</p>

New York: Oxford University Press. <a class="paper" href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780199300518.001.0001/oso-9780199300518-chapter-5" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">This chapter argues that the measurement of well-being is possible, even though well-being cannot be measured on an individual level. This article defines well-being as an ‘inclusive good’ that is influenced by a collection of ‘relevant goods’ (e.g. happiness, positive relationships, etc.). As an individuals’ well-being is self-defined, the well-being of individuals is heterogenous, and is impractical to be measured by one measure (i.e. one questionnaire). However, more generalised types of well-being, such as the “well-being of kinds [of individuals]”, can be measured. This is because: (1) by constraining the definition of well-being to mean a certain collection of relative goods that pertain to a kind, its measurement becomes less heterogenous, and; (2) as the relative goods that make up well-being are measurable constructs, a measure of well-being can be compared against said constructs, giving the measure construct validity.</p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">The author is a variantist – she believes that measured constructs can vary in substance and focus. This view makes (1) possible; variantism supports the belief that there are different forms of well-being. The author also claims that construct validity makes psychometrics a valid form of measurement, similarly to how representational theory makes physical measurement valid.</p>

Hands (Eds.), <i>The Elgar Companion to Recent Economic Methodology</i>: Edward Elgar Publishing. <a class="paper" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1680053#" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">Anger’s paper argues that, as the subjective measures of well-being gains more influence towards economics and public policy, the methodology of well-being measurement is shifting from a measurement-theoretic (i.e.: representational) approach to a psychometric approach. The paper first establishes that ‘orthodox economic measurements’ (e.g. measures of GDP, surplus/deficit, etc.) rely on measurement-theoretical models, which creates a homomorphism that links observable items (such as economic choices and states) to a transitive and associative numeric scale. The author then compares this to the measurement of subjective well-being (e.g. overall happiness, time spent in an unpleasant state, etc.), and how its psychometric approach allows it to measure an unobservable latent variable (like well-being). The author completes his paper by stating that, as the two approaches treat data and evidence in fundamentally different ways, the two approaches are incompatible.</p>

        <p class="content" contenteditable="false">This paper precedes and motivates the arguments made in Vessonnen (2017). While both authors agree that a measure made using one approach cannot be valid in the other, Vessonnen argues that this does not mean the simultaneous endorsement of the two approaches is inconsistent. This paper also compliments Kaminski (2017), as the two both address the socioeconomic usefulness of the psychometric approach.</p>
